For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a composition on the topic: Attend Your Classes Regularly。You should write at least 120 words following the outline given below in Chinese.

1. 现在大学校园里，迟到、早退、旷课是常见的现象
2. 保证学生的出勤率对大学教育的重要性
3. 作为一个大学生应该怎样做

Attend Your Classes Regularly

Nowadays it is a very common phenomenon that some university students are late for or even absent from classes. And still there are some students who slip out of the classroom before the class is over. Class attendance has become a thorny problem to both the students and teachers.

In fact, it is very important for the students to attend their classes regularly. First, it will ensure you to catch up with the teachers in your learning. That is very helpful to you if you want to do a good job in your study. Second, attending classes regularly is a way of showing respect to your teachers ,too. Your teachers will feel bad if the students do not attend their classes, which, in turn, will affect their teaching and be no good for the students. Third, attending classes regularly will help to form a good habit of punctuality, which is of great importance for the students to do a good job in the future.

Therefore, we university students should form the good habit of attending our classes regularly from now on. And some day we'll benefit from it.

**点评** ：2008年元月三日，中山大学博士发帖称遭导师虐待；2008年元月四日，中国政法大学爆"杨帆门"事件；近几年，中小学老师或打学生或猥亵学生、体罚学生等各类新闻不断曝光，进而引发了师生关系的大讨论。本范例题为四级考试传统的问题解决型的写作，与校园生活密切相关。

## 范例二

For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a composition on the topic: Students' Rating of Their Teachers。You should write at least 120 words following the outline given below in Chinese.

1. 学生给老师打分已经普遍
2. 人们对其持不同态度
3. 我的看法

Students' Rating of Their Teachers

Nowadays, it has become as common in colleges and universities for students to grade teachers as for teachers to grade students. In some universities students' rating has even become the only source of information on teaching effectiveness..

This, however, has caused great controversy. Some are in favor of the rating system, They hold that since students attend the teachers' classes every day, they should have their opinion about their teachers' effectiveness. Others, on the contrary, are strongly against it. They believe that there is much more to teaching than what is shown on students' rating forms. Students should not be expected to judge whether the materials they use are up to date or how well the teacher knows about the subject. These judgments require professional knowledge, which is best left for the teachers' colleagues.

I think students' rating of their teachers is necessary, but it should be conducted in a way that can really shed meaningful light on teachers' performance. Instead of rating the teachers' knowledge on the subject, students should be asked to estimate what they have learned in a course, and to report on such things as a teacher's ability to communicate with students, his or her relationship with students, and his or her ability to arouse students' interest in the subject.

**点评** ：越来越多的高校采取让学生给老师打分的形式来了解教学反馈，并以此作为促进教学质量的有效手段。对此做法，管理部门及教学双方褒贬不一，看法迥异。本范例题为校园生活热议话题，值得关注。

## 范例三

Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a composition on the topic On a Harmonious Dormitory Life. You should write at least 120 words following the outline given below in Chinese:

1. 宿舍生活有时会出现不和谐的情况;
2. 一个和谐宿舍生活的必要性;
3. 如何创造和谐的宿舍生活。

On a Harmonious Dormitory Life

Dormitory life is an indispensable part of college life. But sometimes the harmony in the dormitory be disturbed in one way or another.

As is known to all, a harmonious dormitory life is important to college students and benefits all the members. On one hand, we can have a good rest and put our heart into study. On the other hand, we will have a good mood and enjoy being together.

There are several ways to create and maintain a harmonious dormitory life. Firstly, you have to evaluate your life-style and try to get rid of your dirty habits, if there are any. Secondly, when an annoying situation arises, you'll just have to learn to tolerate each other and co-exist. Thirdly, you'll have to share with each other and make good friends.

In conclusion, we should try our best to build a harmonious dormitory life for the sake of good study and good life.

**点评** ："和谐"成为我们当今社会词频概率最高用词，就社会而言，倡导建立和谐社会；就家庭而言，提倡建设和谐家庭；就校园来讲，则要建立和谐校园；和谐两字似乎无所不在，大学生宿舍生活同样需要和谐。本范例题与四级考试热点密切相关，又为典型的校园生活主题，值得关注。

## 范例四

A Brief Introduction to the University

Distinguished guests,

Welcome to our university. Before you start to look around, allow me to give you a brief account of the school.

Founded in 1927, our university is one of this city's earliest universities of liberal arts. It is staffed with an excellent faculty, and has a total enrollment of over 10,000 students. In the past years, it has turned out numerous well-qualified students and found its graduates active in professions of all walks of life.

Since its establishment, the university has always steered itself toward the objective that its students have an overall healthy development. Not only does it provide the students with basic academic courses, but it manages to expose them to the up-to-date knowledge. Besides, students are free to participate in colorful campus activities and social practice, which are intended for broadening their mind and developing their potential talent.

Currently, both our faculty and students are making every effort to improve the quality of our education in the direction of a first-rate university. Thank you.

**点评** ：近几年，随着我国顺利加入世贸组织以及经济全球化步伐的加快，许多国内高校纷纷与国外大学合作办学，教育走向国际化成为人们关注的热点，也是大学生门比较关心的热点问题。本范例题为热议校园生活话题，与2004年旅游景点介绍2006年考查的名校校园开放如出一辙。

## 范例五

Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a letter to a friend who will come to your city to see you. You should write at least 120 words following the outline given below in Chinese:

假设你是李明, 你的一个朋友张伟准备到你所在的城市来旅游，但你有事不能接待。写封信给他，解释你不能接待的原因，并说明你所做的安排。

A Letter to a Friend

Dear Zhang Wei,

I'm glad to know that you are coming to my city during the summer vacation.

However, I'm afraid there's some bad news. I'm planning to take part in an international conference to be held in another city during the time of your visit. All the top scientists in my field will show up at the conference. More importantly, I'm lucky enough to have been selected to give a speech on behalf of my research team at the Conference. I really can't miss it.

I understand that it'll be your first time to this city and I'm your only friend here. I've asked my roommate to meet you at the airport, and you can stay in my room. He is a very nice person and he will show you around the city. Hope you two will get on well and have a nice holiday!

Yours,

Li Ming

**点评** ：本范例题与2001年6月考查的A Letter to a Schoolmate 类似，所不同是写作提示有所不同，2001年6月作文题是写信对校友来度假表示欢迎并在信中提出建议和注意事项，而本范例题是对朋友来访不能接待，同时在信中说明原因及具体安排，内容不一，但话题相仿，写作思路相似，值得关注。

## 范例六

For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a composition on the topic: Living alone or Living with Roommates? You should write at least 120 words following the outline given below in Chinese.

1．有人认为大学里应独自生活

2．另一些认为大学里应与别人同住

3．你的看法

Living alone or Living with Roommates

Nowadays, there has appeared a heated discussion among the college students as to whether they should live alone outside the campus or live together with other roommates in the students' dormitory. Opinions are divided over the matter.

Those who are in favor of Living alone maintain that it is very convenient to live by themselves. They can enjoy absolute freedom in a room of their own. They can have their own timetable without disturbing others. They are also free to equip the room with a personal computer so that they can have easy access to the Internet.

But others argue that living with roommates has attractions of its own. With several students sharing the same room, each person's experiences can be greatly enriched. They can learn a lot from talking to one another. By learning to tolerate the differences between individuals, they can become more mature.

As far as I'm concerned, I prefer to live with roommates because I love the feeling of belonging. Besides, it is a lot cheaper to live in a dorm than to rent an apartment outside the campus.

**点评** ：本文与校园生活密切相关，也是近年来出现的现象，人们对此的看法各异，2003年后，四级作文考查加大了学校生活类题目的考查，因为这类题材不存在地域的差异，不同地域的同学都有话可说。本范例题即为校园生活类话题，与刚考完的四级作文话题类似，符合命题者出题思路，值得引起重视。

## 范例七

Direction: For this part you are allowed 30 minutes to write a composition on the topic :Cell Phones .You should write no less than 120 words and base your composition on the outline below:

1. 描述上图所示的手机用户数的变化情况
2. 出现这种情况的原因
3. 对此现象作出评价

Cell Phones

As is shown in the chart, cell phones are becoming increasingly popular within China. In 1999, the number of cell phones in use was only 2 million, but in 2002, the number reaches 5 million. And in the year 2005, the number has suddenly soared to 9 million.

There are many factors contributing to this development. Firstly, a cell phone has no wires and can be carried everywhere easily. Secondly, a cell phone is something wonderful that we can have fun with news, games, music and chat through sending short messages. Thirdly, the drop in price and the simultaneous improvement in the functions have made it possible for an average person to make use of cell phone.

The wide use of cell phones has made them more and more indispensable in people's daily life. The functions of the cell phone have made certain people reluctant to separate themselves from their cell phone.

**点评** ：随着我国经济的快速发展，人民的生活水平不断改善，通讯业的日新月异的发展，使得手机使用普及化，成为人们日常生活的必需品，对此的利弊人们看法各异。本范例题为热点话题，同样是年轻人较熟悉和经常讨论的话题，值得关注。

## 范例八

Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a short essay on the topic

Advertisement. You should write at least 120 words following the outline given below in Chinese:

1. 广告的作用
2. 广告的形式多样
3. 广告的夸张性

Advertisement

Advertisements are forcing their way into people's lives. People refer to advertisements in their daily lives because they are consumers. The advertisers are usually manufacturers, retailers and salesmen. Their merchandise needs to be advertised to bring it to the attention to the customers. Thus nearly every product is advertised in some way. To a large extent, good advertising leads to success while bad advertising can mean failure.

There are many ways to advertise and 'ads' come in different forms. Newspapers carry advertisements. Some products are publicized on TV and radio which bring them into notice of a wide audience. Billboards also carry advertising. Advertising is a big industry now and many agencies have been set up to furnish a variety of forms..

However, advertising is not always truthful. A product is often misrepresented. The advertiser exaggerates the benefits of the merchandise he wants to sell. Thus, he misrepresents the truth. The consumer falls victim to such advertising. Millions of people have bought advertised products and have been dissatisfied with them。

**点评** ：这是一篇说明文，用说明的表达方式来解说事物，阐明事理。写好说明文，不仅要抓住特征，注意条理，而且要巧妙运用说明方法，像下定义、举例子、作比较、分类别、列数字、打比方等

## 范例九

Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a composition on the topic: A Letter to the President of the University about Improving the Sports Facilities on Campus. You should write no more than 120 words, and base your composition on the outline given below in Chinese:

假设你是李明，请你写一封信给校长，建议改善本校体育设施状况，内容应涉及体育设施对大学生的重要性，对目前学校体育设施的状况可以表扬，可以提出批评建议，也可以兼而有之。

A Letter to the President of the University

Dear Mr. President,

I am writing this letter to you to express my concern about the sports facilities on campus. I have noticed that our university has very limited resources in terms of opportunities to participate in sports, especially given that the number of students on campus is increasing every year.

As we both know, sports are very important for the sound growth of young people. If they have access to quality sports facilities, young people are able to choose a healthier lifestyle, to boost self-esteem and confidence, and to build a positive outlook and sense of achievement.

My proposal is to build a new sports area. It should be designed with soccer players, basketball players, and ping-pong players in mind. It should have a different section for each activity and be available to students all year round. I believe such facilities will meet our sporting needs.

Thank you for your reading this letter.

Yours faithfully,

Li Ming

**点评** ：本范例题仿真度颇高，为校园生活话题，与在校大学生日常生活密切相关，是最近几年侧重考查的题材。2002年1月考查了就本校食堂状况给校长写一封信.

## 范例十

Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a short essay entitled Blog. You should write at least 120 words based on the chart and outline given below:

下图是2007年1-10月中国博客服务人均月度有效浏览时间及增长率，描述变化，说明原因。

Blog

This histogram shows the number of people using blog services from January to October in 2007. From it we can see that the number of users increased monthly from January to August, except February. After two peak months, July and August, the number dropped slightly in September, while in October it picked up again.

Possible reasons for these changes are first, in February Chinese people celebrated the most important festival——Chinese New Year. This means more people spent more time with their families and friends, and therefore they didn't have as much time for surfing online. Secondly, college students are the main users of blog services. While in July and August，they had summer holidays, which enabled them to have more spare time reading and writing blogs. Thirdly, with improvements of blog services and the influence of some "star bloggers", most of whom are celebrities, blogs are becoming an important way for people to express themselves and communicate with others. So more and more people are starting to use these services, which help explain the overall increase shown here.

**点评** ：这是一篇图表题。可以看出，整体呈增长趋势。但是，二月和九月有所下降。所以，分析的时候要照顾各个方面。www.mfyyw.com整理

## 范例十一

Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a short essay on the topic College Students' Job Hunting. You should write at least 120 words following the outline given below.

1. 近几年出现了大学生就业难的现象
2. 产生这种现象的原因（如大学生追求的目标过高，专业不对口等）
3. 如何解决这一问题（改变就业观念，大学生再培训等）

College Students' Job Hunting

In recent years, college students find it increasingly difficult to get a job. It sounds strange since young college students are usually intelligent, well-educated phenomenon, aspirant and eager to bring their talent into full play. Then what underlies the strange phenomenon?

There are several reasons for this. To begin with, nowadays college students aim too high. All they want are "good" jobs which could offer good salary, comfortable working conditions, high social status among others. Consequently, most college students are unwilling to accept vacant jobs they consider not "good" enough. Another reason is that there is a big gap between the majors some students study in school and the demands of vacant jobs. So companies think some students are not fit for the jobs.

Solution to the problem requires efforts on both the society and the students. The companies should value the students, talent and knowledge while the latter should not merely aim at material gains. They should be down-to–earth in building up their career. Furthermore, they should face their weak points so as to improve themselves and be more competent.

**点评** ：本范例题为社会热点话题。近年来大学生就业难日益成为各级政府及社会各方面关注的焦点，媒体也广泛报道了大学生就业形势严峻，呼吁全社会共同努力；此外，该范例题也与大学生就业密切相关，也是四级作文选题重点之一。

## 范例十二

Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a short essay on the topic of traffic jam. You should write at least 120 words following the outline given below.

１．在现代社会，城市交通问题变得越来越严重

２．城市交通问题的表现以及对人们生活的影响

３．解决的方法与措施

Traffic Jam

There is no doubt that traffic congestion becomes a growing worry for the residents of most urban areas. Some major roads are regularly choked with traffic in rush hours. The limited transport capacity contributes largely to the vexing problem. How to solve the headache?.

The existing solutions to traffic jam mainly aim at creating metro bus systems and broadening major roads. Widening the existing roads can solve traffic snarls on some level. Soaring car ownership compounds the chronic annoying problem, so we must sharply reduce the heavy reliance on cars and drive a shift to the mass transportation. It is a cheap and good way. We can create a system of customized bus routes and highlight the development of subways, trolleys and light rail. The effective combination of these solutions will enable the urban areas to possess a smooth traffic.

**点评** ：交通话题一直是四级作文命题话题之一。1990年6月考查过How to solve the problem of Heavy Traffic,1994年1月考题The World Is Getting Smaller and Smaller也与交通有关，近年来，随着私家车的日益增多，城市交通拥堵凸显，出行难越来越成为人们关注的焦点。

Environmental Protection

No one，regardless of race, religion or nationality, can deny that the world we live in is becoming increasingly intolerable because of the effects of global warming. According to many experts, even greater impacts are still on the way.

There are numerous causes for this problem. On one hand, human-related emissions of carbon into the atmosphere is causing, and will in the future cause, significant global warming according to the theory. On the other hand, the lack of knowledge about the importance of protecting environment hinders the solving of the problem.

It is urgent that immediate and effective actions should be taken right away. First, more trees need to be planted to help improve and beautify the environment. Besides, stricter laws concerning global warming and irresponsible use of fuel resources have to be put into effect and achieved good results. In a word, there is a long way to go before we can take a comfortable world for granted again .

Credit Cards. You should write at least 120 words following the outline given below in Chinese:

1. 越来越多的人使用信用卡，信用卡有哪些好处
2. 信用卡的弊端
3. 你自己的观点

Credit Cards

Personal credit cards are becoming more common in China. Banks and other financial institutions are encouraging their customers to change the way they buy things. Credit cards, otherwise known as "plastic money", are being offered on very good terms to encourage the change. Consumers will be able to "buy now, pay later", and many see this as an advantage.

But people need to be careful. There are dangers associated with credit cards. Some people find it very easy to exceed their budget. They are tempted to purchase goods that they do not really need, and can become quickly overburdened by debt. The credit cards often charge a high rate of interest, which exacerbates the problems for these people.

However, used wisely credit cards can improve the quality of people's lives. They can give people access to money to meet sudden unplanned expenses. Properly handled, they can let people control their expenditure and the monthly statements provide a record of where their money has gone.

## 范例十五

Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a composition on the topic Pet Raising . You should write at least 120 words following the outline given below in Chinese:

1．有些人喜欢养动物作为宠物。

2．有些人反对圈养动物作为宠物。

3．你的观点。

Pet Raising

Nowadays, with the improvement of the people's living standard, some people form a habit of raising small or domestic animals as pets. Some raise small dogs or cats as their pets while others raise various birds or fishes as their pets.

However, some people object to the idea of raising animals as pets. To them, animals have their own right to live a natural life like human beings. On the other hand, the way people raise animals as pets have a negative influence on the surroundings ,for example, dogs' chasing people on the street and so on. What's more, some animals will transmit some diseases.

In my opinion, I do not like the idea to raise animals as pets. We should not deprive them of their natural right. In this way, we will live in a peaceful world in harmony with the other living creatures.

## 范例十六

Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a composition on the topic How People Spend Their Holidays. You should write at least 120 words, and base your composition on the table and the outline given below:

1、根据上表，简要描述1990年、1995年、2000年某城市人们度假方式的情况及其变化；

2、请说明发生这些变化的原因；

3、得出结论。

How People Spend Their Holidays

As is clearly shown in the table that there was a dramatic change in the way people spent their holidays between 1990 and 2000. Especially, in 1990, 63% of people spent their holidays at home, while the figure decreased considerably to 24% in 2000. There are three reasons for this phenomenon.

To begin with, with the development of market-oriented economy, people earn by far more money than they used to, making it possible for them to afford traveling expenses. In addition, people realize the importance of getting well-informed about the outside world in this modern era to develop their potential. For example, a traveller may encounter or talk with someone of a different cultural background so as to broaden his vision. Last but not least, by traveling outside, people are close to nature, which is not only beneficial to both their health and peace of mind. In short, more and more people take the occasion of holiday to travel outside and relax themselves.

As far as I am concerned, I prefer to go traveling instead of staying at home during holidays. On the one hand, I love meeting different people and take in some fresh ideas. On the other hand, it is agreed that the world is becoming a global village. No one could confine himself within his small circle of families or relatives. In brief, I have benefited a lot and will benefit more from traveling during the holidays.

**点评** ：该篇作文属图表作文，命题思路与四级真题图表作文一致，仿真度高。本范例题关于人们旅游度假方式的变化，也是社会热点话题，2006年1月就考过名校校园该不该成为旅游景点话题；2004年6月也是关于旅游景点的介绍。

## 范例十八

Directions:

1．上图所示为我国吸毒者年龄分布情况，请描述其变化

2．请说明发生这些变化的原因

3．这一变化对社会和个人的影响

As can be seen from the graph, there have been sharp changes in the age distribution of drug addicts. To be concrete, the teenage addicts only made up 10 percent of all the drugsters in 1982 while the ratio rose up to 65 in 2002.

The causes for them are not hard to find. First , teenagers' fearless curiosity about everything new has led some of them into this marsh. Second, many of the young addicts turned for the first time to drugs for escape either from their failure in the national entrance exams or from their parents' breakup. And above all, our education in the harmfulness of drugs has been far from adequate to build teenagers' sound resistance to drugs. To sum up, the causes mentioned above must call for more of our concern, and effective measures should be taken to check the trend.

Obviously the drastic change will exert great impact on individuals and the whole society.

For one thing, drug-taking does great damage to the health of drug users.. For another, some drug users commit robbery or even murder their parents and relatives to get money to buy drugs, which poses a great threat to the social security and the social stability. Therefore, it is high time we did something to put an end to this trend.

**点评** ：该范例题为社会热点话题，四级考试命题作文常考题材。本文属于图表作文的写作。根据四级图表作文命题规律，第一段文章描述了图表中所反映的我国吸毒者年龄的分布最近二十年的变化情况，；第二段说明了产生这种变化的原因；最后一段陈述了吸毒无论是对个人的身体健康和社会的安全和稳定都构成了巨大的威胁，呼吁全社会共同努力消除这种不良现象。

Aid Education in China

Each year, college students, encouraged to aid students in the poverty-stricken areas, volunteer themselves in poor villages for a year and try to improve education in poor areas.

Aid-education has been beneficial in two aspects. On the one hand, college volunteers are really devoted to the cause. They have opened the eyes of students in underdeveloped regions to the outside world by bringing them new knowledge and thoughts. As a result, they are extremely well-received by the children there. On the other hand, college students have received a rigorous training by adapting to the harsh living conditions. They are enjoying the appreciation and no-distance friendship from the children. What's more, they are greatly inspired by the moving and tireless spirit of the children.

In my opinion, China's educational development can't be isolated from each individual and we college students should take the lead in response to the appeal for offering aid to children in poor areas.

Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a short essay. You should write at least 120 words following the outline given below:

1. 现在某些高校校园禁止车辆驶入，
2. 这种规定的考虑，
3. 谈谈你的看法。

Should cars be allowed into College Campus?

With the rapid development of our national economy, private cars have become in large number; of course, quite a few cars are heavily driven into College Campus.

In a significant way, these cars do not take up students' places for study, but actually affect their daily life and study-- for instance, this crowd of cars may make noise and emit filthy gas to choke us to death. And the campus is jammed with lines of cars and seems to be parking lot instead of an academic institute. So cars have been strictly prohibited into many College Campuses. It seems that this is not convenience to some persons, indeed, but this is for the sake of our safety. Thus when someone enjoys convenience from modern tools, don't forget that it is dangerous to the students in the College Campus. Therefore, I agree that cars are not allowed into College Campus.

By and large, with the price of cars falling significantly, cars will enter average families, and most Chinese will enjoy a luxurious lifestyle in their life. However, they are still prohibited to drive their cars into College Campus, which , I think, is a hard truth in the eyes of most people.

**点评** ：随着人们物质生活的提高，私家车发展迅猛，越来越多的私家车停放在校园，由此产生了一些问题，如空间被占、噪音污染、环境污染等，为此许多学校禁止车辆驶入校园，本范例题与2006年1月名校校园是否对外开放相仿，值得关注。

For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a composition on the topic : Information Security. You should write at least 120 words following the outline given below in Chinese.

1. 信息安全问题日益重要
2. 信息安全事故可能导致的危害
3. 如何做到信息安全

Information Security

The human beings are stepping into the information society. The information industry develops very rapidly, so do the hackers, trick-playing teens, exploring children, fraudsters, and serious white-collar criminals. Thus, information security becomes an impending important issue.

In case of information breach, the victims-----government department, an organization or an institution, or a company will inevitably suffer great or small loss. Government may be threatened with national security. Companies may lose opportunities to develop new projects. And the public's and users' confidence will be damaged.

Then how to deal with this issue? Technology is only a partial solution to information security. What's more important is that organizations and companies should promote the awareness on information security to its staff. However, since no system can ever be 100 percent secure, a prevention-only approach to information security management is not enough. Companies and organizations should adopt a dual approach to information security management by combing prevention and detection techniques.

**点评** ：随着我们步入信息社会和计算机应用的普及，利用计算机犯罪案件不断上升，信息安全事故频繁发生，媒体也不时有大量相关报道，如何保护信息安全成为人们关注的焦点，本范例题为社会热点，值得关注。

Directions:For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a composition on the topic: No pains,no gains You should write at least120 words following the outline below in Chinese.

1. 为什么说"不劳就无获"
2. 试举例说明

No pains, no gains

Nearly every civilization has its own equivalent to the proverb " No pains, no gains." It means that nothing can be gained without painstaking efforts and that no knowledge or skill can be acquired without sweat or toil.

You don't have to look very far too prove the truth of the proverb. Darwin's great discovery was not the work of a moment but was preceded by years of patient, arduous observation. Mozart was not an accomplished pianist at the age of eight as the result of watching countless hours of TV. Nor did Edison make himself the greatest inventor in the modern world by spending his spare time on going to parties or bars. His words "Genius is 99 percent perspiration and one percent inspiration ,reveals the secret of thousands of successful men and women. All accomplishments and success come from sustained endeavor.

Although it is an old saying," no pains no gains" has its profound and realistic significance in our college studies. To acquire knowledge in a particular field and to attain any academic goals, great exertion and persistent effort are undoubtedly required because we all know that "No pains, no gains."

**点评** ：该范例题与四级1997年1月作文命题类似，属于论证道理性的解释性说明文写作，已有多年未考，值得关注。根据此类作文命题规律，第一段对这一格言所蕴涵的意义做了解释和界定。第二段举例说明了其哲理性；最后一段说明它的现实意义，重述主题。

Directions:For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a composition on the topic: Lectures or Discussions. You should write at least 120 words following the outline given below in Chinese.

1．一些学生赞成讲座式教学

2．另一些学生偏爱讨论式教学

3．你的看法

Lectures and Discussions

There is a heated debate over the role of lectures and discussions in the classroom. Some people believe that lectures can help students learn more quickly. In contrast, others hold that discussions can stimulate students to learn by themselves.

Those who hold the first opinion suggest that students attend more lectures. In their view, by giving lectures teachers help students master the knowledge they've accumulated over years of study and research. However, others think that in a discussion, the teacher usually guides the students instead of dominating them. They argue that to get involved in a discussion, students have to develop their ability to analyze problems independently.

In my opinion, I stand on the side of neither idea. First of all, either method has its disadvantages. Furthermore, each student has his or her preference. Thirdly, lectures ate preferable to discussions in the teaching of science subjects, and on the contrary, discussions are preferable to lectures in studying the humanities. Therefore, we should adopt different teaching methods according to different subjects.

**点评** ：2007年12月考查了大学生选修课话题，再次证明四级作文命题自2003年以后侧重于校园生活话题，该范例与校园生活联系紧密，为四级作文命题经常关注的话题。本文属于对比观点加作者态度型的议论文写作。

## 范例二十六

Directions:For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a composition on the topic: My View on Online Education.You should write at least 120 words following the outline given below in Chinese.

1. 目前网络教育形成热潮
2. 你认为这股热潮形成的原因
3. 你对网络教育的评价

My View on Online Education.

Being online is no longer something new or fresh in our life. To some extent, it has become part of our daily life. We can do a lot of things online, such as searching for information and communicating with friends far away. But recently another helpful online activity has become very "in". That is online education.

Why could online education be so popular within such a short period of time? Among other reasons, the quick development of the Internet should be an essential one, which makes all our dreams of attending class in the distance possible. Another underlying reason is the quick development of both society and technology. Today, modern science and technology is developing with fantastic speed. To catch up with this development we all feel an urgent and strong desire to study. However, due to the great pace of modern society, many people are too busy to study full time at school. Online education just comes to their aid.

Personally, I appreciate this new form of education. It's indeed a helpful complement to the traditional educational means. It can provide different learners with more flexible and versatile ways of learning. Best of all, with online education, we can stick to our jobs and at the same time study and absorb the latest knowledge.

**点评** ：英特网的迅速发展改变了人们的生活和学习、工作方式，现代生活节奏快、工作忙导致人们没时间全日制的学习，网络和远程教育正好满足了人们的学习需要，许多大学生利用因特网学习知识，它成为传统教学的有益补充。本范例题贴近时代，也与大学生校园生活相关，值得重视。

Directions:For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a composition on the topic: Pollution: An Increasing Concern in China You should write at least120 words following the outline below in Chinese.

1．中国的污染的现状

2．造成污染的原因

3．解决的办法

Pollution: An Increasing Concern in China

It is reported that ten big cities in China are being ranked among the top twenty cities with the highest pollution index in the world. This means it is high time we did something to bring the situation under control.

Many factors are contributing to the deteriorating situation: industrial wastes pumped into the air, the lakes and rivers; a increasing number of automobiles crowding into the streets; the widespread use of plastic bags etc.

To my view, stiffer laws and regulations must be implemented to check pollution. Industries that release wastes without permission should be heavily fined. Cars should be equipped to minimize the exhaust they release into the air. And the use of plastic bags and disposable meal boxes should be banned. What's more, the media should play an important role in implanting a sense of environmental consciousness into people's mind.

If everybody works toward a common goal of making the environment better, we can create a cleaner and lovelier world for us and for the coming generation.

**点评** ：该范例题为社会热点话题，也是四级命题作文经常关注的环境问题，值得引起重视。本文属于解释性说明文的写作，主题是"污染"。

## 范例二十八

For this part, you are required to write a composition about 120 words on the topic: Changes in People's Daily Expenses. Your composition should be written on the following table and Chinese given below.

1. 描述图表中人们每天开支变化情况
2. 请说明发生这些变化的原因
3. 结合图表对未来作出合理的范例

Changes in People's Daily Expenses.

What is shown in the table above indicates that dramatic changes have taken place in the people's daily expenses from 1995 to 1999. The expenses on food have declined by 30% while those on clothing and recreation have increased respectively by 9% and 7% . The statistics of rise and fall seem to exist in isolation but closely related to one another .

There are two factors accounting for these changes. Development in economy is an essential one in the five years. The increased income resulting from economic growth plays an important part in the less expense on food. Hence, a small percentage of total income is enough to cover food expense. Another one is the changes in life style. When food presents no worry to the average, people begin to focus more of interest on handsome appearance and happy leisure time . As a result of such a shift, spending on clothing and recreation increases year after year.

From the analyses made above, we may come to the conclusion that people's living standards have been constantly improved between 1995 and 1999. With the further growth in economy and more changes in life style, the tendency indicated in the table will continue in the better direction .

**点评** ：该范例题属于图表作文写作，与社会生活密切相关，与1991年6月份四级考试人们饮食结构的变化图表作文写作类似。根据四级图表作文命题规律，第一段描述人们1995到1999年日常开支所发生的巨大变化；第二段分析产生变化的原因；最后一段依据图表所示变化作出了合乎逻辑的范例。文章紧扣主题，条理清楚，语言连贯，表述准确规范，结论合理。

## 范例三十

Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a composition on the topic Choosing an Occupation. You should write at least 120 words following the outline given below in Chinese:

1. 选择职业是一个人要面对的众多难题之一。
2. 需要花时间去选择职业。
3. 选择职业时可以向多人寻求建议和帮助。

Choosing an Occupation

One of the most important problems a young person faces is deciding what to do. There are some people, of course, who from the time they are six years old "know" that they want to be doctors or pilots or fire fighters, but the majority of us do not get around to making a decision about an occupation or career until somebody or something forces us to face the problem.

Choosing an occupation takes time, and there are a lot of things you have to think about as you try to decide what you would like to do. You may find that you will have to take special courses to qualify for a particular kind of work, or you may find out that you will need to get actual work experience to gain enough knowledge to qualify for a particular job.

Fortunately, there are a lot of people you can turn to for advice and help in making your decision. At most schools, there are teachers who are professionally qualified to give you detailed information about job qualifications. And you can talk over your ideas with family members and friends who are always ready to listen and to offer suggestions.
