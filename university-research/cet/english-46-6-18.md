### My View on Fake Commodities

　　Nowadays fake commodities have flooded almost every inch of the market. Wherever you are, whatever you do, it seems that you can hardly have fallen prey to them. In other words, it is highly probable that you have bought some of those fake goods or products of inferior quality。

　　Needless to say, fake commodities have already done great harm to our society. On the one hand, they will ruin the good reputation of genuine products and disturb the balance of the market. On the other hand, the prevalence of such products has hindered interpersonal relationship and resulted in the decline of public morality. As a consequence, they have wasted exhaustible resources, endangered people&#39;s precious life and health, and in the long run eroded public trust。

Then, what should be done to do away with fake commodities? To start with, the government needs to tighten its inspection program and strengthen its enforcement policies. Secondly, honest businessmen should modify some long-accepted practices at the protection of their intellectual property right. Most important of all, we consumers will have to do a better job of learning how to distinguish between the genuine and the phoney and definitely say no to the fake ones. In one word, the coordinated effort of the whole society will put an end to fake commodities.

Knowledge and Diploma

1.        目前社会上存在这样一种说法：文凭越高越吃香;

2.而有些人则认为文凭不等于知识;  你的观点

Knowledge and Diploma

It is generally believed that a high diploma guarantees a promising future. Some people identify high diplomas with profound knowledge and exceptional competence. Companies also tend to emphasize the academic achievement of a job candidate. Like it or not, there does exist a social reality – the higher diplomas one gets, the more popular he becomes.

On the contrary, other people claim that a high diploma doesn&#39;t automatically translate into knowledge. A diploma, in their eyes, is only the acknowledgment of one&#39;s educational experience rather than a guarantee of one&#39;s ability. Therefore, we can never measure the depth of one&#39;s knowledge by the grade of one&#39;s diploma. Besides, many knowledgeable people don&#39;t have a high diploma. Take Bill Gates for example. His dropping out of college cannot deny the fact that he is one of the world&#39;s most learned men.

    So I must say no one should ever equate a diploma with knowledge, because a diploma is nothing but a proof of a short-term study while genuine knowledge needs one&#39;s lifelong devotion.

The Rise of Shanzhai Culture

1.        最近兴起了一股&quot;山寨热&quot;;

2.你如何看待山寨现象

●        审题概述●本文是一篇论述山寨现象以及人们和你对此看法的文章。第一段，概述方兴未艾的山寨热。第二段，阐述山寨产品的优势以及给人们带来的好处。第三段，论述人们和你对山寨现象的反对立场和观点，即山寨产品的非法性。

The Rise of Shanzhai Culture

The vast array of knockoff name-brand products, such as cell phones, DVDs, MP3 players, have made &quot;shanzhai&quot; the hottest word of the year. Now we wear shanzhai watches, talk through shanzhai cell phones, play shanzhai video games, use shanzhai computers, even watch shanzhai TV shows. Once a term used before some electronic products to suggest a copycat version of inferior quality, shanzhai now suggests to many Chinese creativity and trendiness. With the media all over the rise of shanzhai culture, public opinions are clearly divided.

Advocates invariably associate it with innovation, stylishness, the DIY spirit, open-mindedness and practicality, as shanzhai products often mix imitation with innovation —a similar skin but a different heart. The end products are usually more functional and much cheaper than the original. Besides, they respond to the market more swiftly and they are more considerate in design. Thanks to them, more people at the grassroots level can enjoy the benefit of modern technology.

However, other people, including myself, hold more reserved attitudes towards the shanzhai fever. For all the popularity it has won, a copycat is a copycat. The mockery of the prestige products not only steals their profits but also upsets market competition. Moreover, shanzhai products thrive on the current legal loopholes. Under the disguise of anti-dominance slogans, they make illegal profits by violating intellectual property rights and evading taxes. And to top it off, the so-called innovation is only senseless talk as true innovation always faces huge costs and potential failures, while plagiarism simply builds success on other people&#39;s risks.

It&#39;s Time to Stop Software Piracy

1.        盗版软件比比皆是;

2.盗版软件猖獗的原因;

3.如何打击盗版软件

●        审题概述●这是一篇主要论述盗版软件猖獗原因和打击盗版软件的措施的文章。第一段，概述中国盗版软件泛滥的情况。第二段，重点分析盗版软件猖獗的主要原因。第三段，侧重阐述打击盗版软件的措施。

It&#39;s Time to Stop Software Piracy

China has often been criticized for the rampant practice of software piracy. Take a look around. We operate on pirated Windows systems, defend PC security with pirated Kaspersky anti-virus programmes, process files with pirated Microsoft Office, draft 3D designs with pirated AutoCAD, refine pictures with pirated Adobe Photoshop, and study English with pirated Kingsoft&#39;s electronic dictionaries and translators. It&#39;s no exaggeration that pirated software is everywhere.

The logic behind the phenomenon is simple and clear: if a pirated copy is available for just a tiny fraction of the normal price, not to speak of many of the free downloads online, who would pay for an authentic copy? Cheaper prices aside, easy access is another important factor. With such a large gathering of pirated upgrades around, who would bother to spend time and money searching the stores for an authorized yet outdated version?

Despite these apparent benefits, the practice of software piracy should be banned, because it represents unfair competition and by nature it&#39;s a no-win situation. But how? Two approaches are to be taken at the same time: Technically, software developers should enhance their antipiracy engineering, so that cracking the software should be virtually impossible. And legally, the government should also tighten its antipiracy laws and toughen up the penalties, so that violations should be costly.

金融危机

2.金融危机对大学生造成何种影响;

3.作为大学生，应怎样应对这种影响.

●        审题概述●这是一篇主要论述金融危机与大学生关系的文章。第一段，概述金融危机给世界造成的影响。第二段，论述金融危机给大学生带来的就业、经济等影响。第三段，阐述大学生面对金融危机带来的影响应提高专业技能等。

Effects of Financial Crisis on College Students

Since the financial crisis swept the world, the global economy has sunk into a severe recession. It&#39;s hard to get through a day without hearing or reading news about the devastating effects of the crisis: A world of companies go bankrupt, millions of employees are laid off, high-return investment bubbles burst, and huge sums of loans can never be retrieved. Its impact on our daily life can be felt in all walks of life.

College students inevitably fall victim to this pervasive slump as well. On top of that, internships and job vacancies are reduced to the minimum as companies keep shrinking. New graduates find themselves hard to get a job, not to speak of a satisfactory one. What comes next? Poor students will be hard-pressed if they find student loans unavailable any more. As a result, some even cannot afford to continue their studies. Lastly, more students are probably out there anxiously looking for part-time jobs now that they have to help cover their expenses in this gloomy economy. Their innocence and eagerness might be taken advantage of by some malicious business people, or even criminal gang.

In response to these threats, we students must act promptly and wisely. Since we definitely will be facing a competitive job market, it&#39;s crucial that we submit high quality resumes. Therefore, we must commit more to our professional studies. Even do better, master more relevant job skills as a double security. Furthermore, apply for scholarships and grants, as these are still available and we don&#39;t have to pay them back. As for the safety issues, trust our instinct —there&#39;s no free lunch in this world. Anything that promises quick returns without much work is a sure trap. Stay alert and protect ourselves.

Volunteering actions

　　In recent years, the volunteering spirit has spread among the Chinese people, especially among youngsters. According to a survey, in 2008, there were about 1,700,000 volunteers who offered service for Olympic Games. Actually, an increasing number of people become volunteers every year in China。

　　Volunteering actions are of tremendous benefits to both those in need and the society. Olympic Games are a good example. As is known to all, volunteers played an active role in Beijing Olympic Games. Without them, it would be a tough task to hold this un-precedent Olympic Games. Therefore, we can say that it was those volunteers who ensured the success of these games。

　　As modern college students, we should get actively involved in volunteering activities. By participating, we can learn how to work well in a team, how to improve our interpersonal skills and organizational ability. Undoubtedly, all of these are critical for our person growth. So, we should take this chance to learn and to grow.

大城市就业还是小城镇

1. 很多的大学生毕业后留在大城市工作；　

2. 也有人选择到小城镇开始自己的职业生涯；

3. 结合自己的实际情况谈谈自己的想法。

　　Want to be a small fish in a big pond or the other way round? Every graduate faces this question when starting his career. A large number of college graduates prefer to stay in big cities,which mean more experiences, more opportunities to see the big world and more space for career development. At the sam e time, higher salary is another temptation。

　　But some other graduates intend to start in small towns. Even though there may not be many big companies, they can have a quieter and less competitive life. Another reason is that they can be a big fish in a small pond. They can easily get the management&#39;s attention and may win promotion earlier。

As far as I am concerned, I prefer to start in a metropolis like Shanghai. A good begin is half the battle, and in Shanghai I can find a job in a big company where I can meet people from different places and cultures. I will learn from them what I can not get from textbooks.

Should College Students Live on Campus

c. 我的看法

Should College Students Live on Campus

There are an increasing number of students who choose to live off campus. Parents and university administrations understandably reacted differently. They voiced concerns about security and the threat of off-campus lifestyles getting out of control. However, college students have their own reasons for their choices。

　　Some students prefer to live on campus for the following reasons. First, campus residents are closer to classes, the library, and other resources, so they are more likely to succeed in college and complete their bachelor&#39;s degree in four years. Furthermore, Living in a dorm is a great opportunity to meet all kinds of new people and develop relationships with them, so students living on campus are more sociable. Last but not the least, living on campus is cheaper and more convenient. Often times, off-campus housing is more expensive than on-campus housing and while living on campus, you don&#39;t have to worry about monthly rent payments and utility bills。

　　Some others choose to live off campus because they believe living off campus they are more independent, with more privacy and a lot more quiet time. Living off campus gives them freedom from those dorm rules and allow them to set their own. The extra space also means that one can probably find a quiet place to study in the convenience of his own home。

　　As for me, I&#39;m a faithful supporter of the former group because I, living on campus myself, have witnessed and enjoyed all the convenience and happiness of doing so. To me, living on campus undoubtedly adds an important element to the complete college experience。

Pursuit of A Master&#39;s Degree

a. 根据下图描述某校毕业生毕业意向的变化

b. 分析选择读研的毕业生数目增加的原因

　　c. 说明选择读研对个人和社会产生的影响

　　

　　It is illustrated in the pie charts that graduates&#39; choices after graduation have experienced much change. The number of students choosing to pursue a master&#39;s degree and study abroad grows several times over the decade。

　　The reasons of the increasing number of students pursuing a master&#39;s degree are as follows. First, with the number of college graduates growing each year, the situation in the job market is getting tighter and tighter. The public awareness of the situation has created a surge of interest in seeking a master&#39;s degree. Secondly, many cross-national companies set a much higher standard for new recruits than ever. It seems that the higher education you have, the higher salary you may receive。

　　Choosing to study for master&#39;s degree will benefit the individuals and the whole society as well. The quality of Chinese intellectuals will be considerably enhanced, which in turn will boost the progress of the whole society。

### 范文 赏 析（十）

Directions : For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write an essay entitled Say &quot;Thank You&quot; to Parents. You should write at least 150 words following the outline given below in Chinese:

1. 很多的大学生从未跟父母道过谢

2. 请说明原因

3. 你的建议

　　According to a recent survey involving over 3000 undergraduates, 35% of university students have never said &quot;Thank you&quot; to their parents. Their parents have done all they could to bring them up in the past score of years, but have never been rewarded with gratitude。

　　The subjects claim such reasons as follows. First and foremost, a quarter of the interviewed students regard it as parents&#39; duty to support them spiritually and financially. And it is not necessary to express appreciation to their parents. However, the majority of youngsters are aware of their parents&#39; tender love but are not accustomed to saying &quot;Thank you&quot;. Some even find a generation gap between themselves and their parents, thus feeling reluctant to express their affection for their parents。

　　In my opinion, extending thankfulness to our parents is a way of respecting them and their love. We should express our feelings directly and bravely, but what&#39;s more important is, we should do all that we can to reward them。

     Fire Prevention on Campus

　　People are alarmed by the succession of campus fires in recent years. In each of these accidents, heavy casualties were reported – houses were burned down, students lost their lives, and properties were damaged. Faced with such a chilling fact, people keep asking, &quot;What on earth results in these repeated tragedies?&quot;

　　A brief survey of them reveals that human factors still prove to be the leading causes. For example, three of these fires were caused by the students&#39; use of electric water-heaters. As students often leave the heaters unattended, the risks are rather high should the water in the bottle boil dry while no one is around to turn off the power. In other cases, fires were also caused by stoves, candles, cigarette butts, etc。

　　Since most of these disasters could have been prevented if proper precautions had been taken, students should be better educated on the importance and measures of fire control. The following three reminders are of particular importance for us students: First, learn how to use a fire extinguisher. Second, double-check candles, heaters, stoves and other electric appliances, and make sure there are no open flames before leaving rooms. Lastly, do not smoke in the dorm.

Enhance Awareness to Guard against Campus Thefts

　　&quot;If you don&#39;t want to wake up and find you have no pants to wear, you&#39;d better put them on in sleep,&quot; goes a popular joke among students. Obviously, campus thefts have become increasingly annoying as they occur far more often than before. And it seems that the thieves are less choosy these days, with their targets ranging widely from bikes, cell phones, purses, pre-paid IC cards to sunglasses, bags, and even underwear. In short, anything that worth a dime is likely to be stolen。

　　What makes students the easy targets? The reasons are not hard to find. But I believe of all these reasons, the lack of anti-theft alertness is the most important. For lack of alertness, the students tend to leave the doors and windows wide open during sleep at noon or at night in summer. For the same reason, they&#39;ll also leave their bikes unlocked before a store or by a road, or forget to take away their personal stuff before they go out of the classroom to make a phone call. These acts undoubtedly have increased their exposure to the light-fingered monsters。

　　In order to minimize possible losses, the students must stay on guard in the first place, as awareness of the thefts around often makes a big difference. To be more specific, the students should not hide any tempting amount of cash in the dorm. Put it in the bank instead. Besides, do not leave any valuable items unattended. Take them wherever you go. In addition, it&#39;s advisable to develop a neighbourhood watch programme with other students in the dorm and neighbouring dorms。

How Will Our Life Go on without Internet?

　　If asked whether the Internet is the greatest discovery of the 20th century, my answer would be yes. The Internet has drawn the world closer together, realized countless incredible dreams, and provided modern people with a great many conveniences and a brilliant life。

　　Today, many people simply feel they cannot live without the Internet. Governments publish their latest policies and decisions online for worldwide recognition. Political campaigns are often done online to gain wider public support. Companies and enterprises resort to the Internet for more business opportunities and potential customers home and abroad. Universities and researchers turn to the Internet if they&#39;d seek international cooperation or funding. Common folks like us also rely on the cyber world in various ways, for communication, entertainment, banking and shopping。

　　True, the power of the Internet is all pervasive and its many negative effects are already visible. For example, Internet addicts tend to withdraw to their own fantasy world rather than communicate with a real person. Children are exposed to online pornography and violence. Internet frauds are an everyday occurrence. In view of all this, you are advised to use the Internet with wisdom. Keep it at a safe distance and never lose yourself。

University Students&#39; Pursuit of Famous Brands

　　1.         现在很多大学生都追求穿名牌，用名牌

　　这是一篇论述对大学生追求和使用名牌看法的文章。第一段，详述大学生热衷追求、使用名牌的情形以及人们的看法。第二段，重点谈你对此的看法。

University Students&#39; Pursuit of Famous Brands

　　&quot;What perfumes are you wearing?&quot; &quot;Aren&#39;t your shoes Nike&#39;s latest release?&quot; &quot;I like the Mickey bag you bought yesterday。&quot; &quot;I hear the Jack &amp; Jones store is on sale this week. Do you wanna come along?&quot; Don&#39;t feel surprised if you hear them coming out of the mouth of college students. It&#39;s quite common to hear and see college students swapping information about the brands they like and the products they use. In fact, discussions about brand names have become one of the college students&#39; favourite pastimes. They learn about the latest fashion from each other, exchange tips about when and where to get the item, and buy it at their earliest convenience. &quot;Keeping up with the Joneses&quot; is their conviction – &quot;If the Joneses have it, how could I have not?&quot;

　　About this current mindset of the college students, many people may hasten to show their disapproval. They&#39;ll probably take it to be a reflection of the students&#39; vanity and superficiality. And they may lecture them on the virtue of being thrifty。

　　However, I beg to differ. For one thing, name-brand products are usually quality products. As such, they are something beautiful, endurable, and reliable. &quot;The love of beauty is common to all,&quot; goes the proverb; therefore, there&#39;s nothing to blame about the pursuit of famous brands. For the other, college students are old enough to make their own decisions. Likewise, they must abide by the consequences if they make an ill-advised one. If they let their pursuit of brands eat into their budget for other more important issues, they should be able to correct their mistakes and keep everything in moderation. So this becomes no other than a good chance to learn management, isn&#39;t it?

Should parents send their kids to art classes?

　　A child&#39;s world is supposed to be fresh and new and beautiful, full of wonder and excitement. Unfortunately, this is not the case for some kids, especially for those born and bred in cities --- their joys are dimmed and even lost because a majority of them are forced to attend various art classes。

　　Some claim that it is beneficial for children&#39;s development. They might have their reasons because most parents are convinced that their kids are gifted gifts from the god. They presume that the earlier their children are exposed to arts, the more likely it is to find out the artistic potential hidden in them. Even if their children fail to become another child prodigy like Lang Lang or Li Yundi, the interests in arts, say, in music, cultivated in childhood will be of great value in their whole life。

　　In spite of the possible benefits mentioned, I, like others, am strongly against it. The major harm is that it might deprive children of their pleasure to play after school. Faced with competition and contest for better universities, most children are buried in piles of homework. Forcing them to art classes will leave them less time to enjoy the beauty of the nature or to find their talent in things they are really interested in。

　　To sum up, childhood is a time for children to play as they wish. Rather than cramming knowledge, it is more important to pave the way for their desire to know than to put them on a diet of facts they are not ready to assimilate。
