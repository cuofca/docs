Attend Your Classes Regularly

Nowadays it is a very common phenomenon that some university students are late for or even absent from classes. And still there are some students who slip out of the classroom before the class is over. Class attendance has become a thorny problem to both the students and teachers.

In fact, it is very important for the students to attend their classes regularly. First, it will ensure you to catch up with the teachers in your learning. That is very helpful to you if you want to do a good job in your study. Second, attending classes regularly is a way of showing respect to your teachers ,too. Your teachers will feel bad if the students do not attend their classes, which, in turn, will affect their teaching and be no good for the students. Third, attending classes regularly will help to form a good habit of punctuality, which is of great importance for the students to do a good job in the future.

Therefore, we university students should form the good habit of attending our classes regularly from now on. And some day we'll benefit from it.

On a Harmonious Dormitory Life

Dormitory life is an indispensable part of college life. But sometimes the harmony in the dormitory be disturbed in one way or another.

As is known to all, a harmonious dormitory life is important to college students and benefits all the members. On one hand, we can have a good rest and put our heart into study. On the other hand, we will have a good mood and enjoy being together.

There are several ways to create and maintain a harmonious dormitory life. Firstly, you have to evaluate your life-style and try to get rid of your dirty habits, if there are any. Secondly, when an annoying situation arises, you'll just have to learn to tolerate each other and co-exist. Thirdly, you'll have to share with each other and make good friends.

In conclusion, we should try our best to build a harmonious dormitory life for the sake of good study and good life.

假设你是李明, 你的一个朋友张伟准备到你所在的城市来旅游，但你有事不能接待。写封信给他，解释你不能接待的原因，并说明你所做的安排。

A Letter to a Friend

Dear Zhang Wei,

I'm glad to know that you are coming to my city during the summer vacation.

However, I'm afraid there's some bad news. I'm planning to take part in an international conference to be held in another city during the time of your visit. All the top scientists in my field will show up at the conference. More importantly, I'm lucky enough to have been selected to give a speech on behalf of my research team at the Conference. I really can't miss it.

I understand that it'll be your first time to this city and I'm your only friend here. I've asked my roommate to meet you at the airport, and you can stay in my room. He is a very nice person and he will show you around the city. Hope you two will get on well and have a nice holiday!

Yours,

Li Ming

范文5

1． 有人认为大学里应独自生活

2． 另一些认为大学里应与别人同住

3． 你的看法

Living alone or Living with Roommates

Nowadays, there has appeared a heated discussion among the college students as to whether they should live alone outside the campus or live together with other roommates in the students' dormitory. Opinions are divided over the matter.

Those who are in favor of Living alone maintain that it is very convenient to live by themselves. They can enjoy absolute freedom in a room of their own. They can have their own timetable without disturbing others. They are also free to equip the room with a personal computer so that they can have easy access to the Internet.

But others argue that living with roommates has attractions of its own. With several students sharing the same room, each person's experiences can be greatly enriched. They can learn a lot from talking to one another. By learning to tolerate the differences between individuals, they can become more mature.

As far as I'm concerned, I prefer to live with roommates because I love the feeling of belonging. Besides, it is a lot cheaper to live in a dorm than to rent a apartment outside the campus.

1. Direction:\*\* For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a composition entitled Aid Education in China. You should write at least 120 words according to the following guidelines \(given in Chinese\):

   1\) 每年，高校许多大学生受到鼓舞去贫困地区支教。

2\) 支教活动的意义。

3\) 我的看法。

Aid Education in China

Each year, college students, encouraged to aid students in the poverty—stricken areas, volunteer themselves in poor villages for a year and try to improve education in poor areas.

Aid—education has been beneficial in two aspects. On the one hand, college volunteers are really devoted to the cause. They have opened the eyes of students in underdeveloped regions to the outside world by bringing them new knowledge and thoughts. As a result, they are extremely well—received by the children there. On the other hand, college students have received a rigorous training by adapting to the harsh living conditions. They are enjoying the appreciation and no—distance friendship from the children. What's more, they are greatly inspired by the moving and tireless spirit of the children.

In my opinion, China's educational development can't be isolated from each individual and we college students should take the lead in response to the appeal for offering aid to children in poor areas.

1. Direction: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a composition entitled On Power Failure. You should write at least 120 words according to the following guidelines\(given in Chinese\):

   1\) 很多城市缺电现象严重 2\) 分析原因 3\) 提出建议 **On Power Failure** Recently, every morning when I wake up, I find my air-conditioner automatically turned off . I didn't understand why at first, but soon I learned that there was a great shortage of electricity supply in our city – my air-conditioner turned off because of a power failure midnight. With the rapidly developing industry and the ever-increasing population, demand for electricity supply is soaring. Besides, summers in recent years are much hotter than before , so most working places and households are air-conditioned , which consumes additional electricity. Facing with such a hard nut, we have to find ways to crack it. Above all, in western areas China, there is surplus of electricity supply. So, cities that are thirsty for electricity may ask for remote help. Then, when we have electricity, we should remember to save it. Set your air-conditioners at 27℃ and you won't feel less comfortable than when they are at 26℃. In fact, some factories already shift their working hours to avoid the peak time of electricity consuming. My parents don't work from Monday to Friday as before – they work form Saturday to Wednesday and have the following two days off instead. This is also a way out, isn't it?

2008 Olympics and I

As we all know, the 2008 Olympic Games will be held in Beijing, which is a great event for people all over the world. It will be significant for Chinese people. To begin with, the coming Olympic Games will make us know more about the history of the Olympic Games. Second, the Games will attract more and more foreigners interested in Chinese culture. Above all, the Games will improve economic development in China.

As for me, I will improve my personality to welcome the coming Games as the host. I think it is the most important to improve my oral English because there will be a lot of foreigners coming at the time and many interpreter will be wanted. Then, I will learn more knowledge about Chinese culture and spread it to the foreign friends.

There's no doubt that Beijing will be a focus in the coming 2008.More and more people from different countries will know more about Beijing and China. Absolutely, they will take a fancy to China, the country with modern air.

法。

2\) 为什么要提倡"绿色奥运"。 3\) 提倡绿色奥运，从自己做起。

绿色奥运\(Green Olympics\) Olympic Games, as we all know, is a historic sports meeting. "Green Olympics", is one of the three themes of Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. At present, people's life is being flooded with exhaust gas from automobile, blue film, waste water and so on. Owing to these phenomena, we should advocate "Green Olympics", and I am positive of this point. Two possible reasons are as follows. Firstly, environmental protection benefits people's health. In terms of increasing number of trashes around us, such as white plastic bags, one-off cups and chopsticks, it is sensible of disposing of them reasonably. So we ought to use clean technology, renewable and recyclable materials. Secondly, environmental protection is crucial to our country, and even to the world. Lots of countries attached more attention to embrace the Olympic spirits---"higher, faster, and stronger" well. In conclusion, as college students and the young generation, we should try our best to advocate "Green Olympics". The 2008 Olympic Games will be a green and unique Olympics.

1. Directions:For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a composition on the topic How to Solve the Housing Problem in Big Cities? You should write at least  120 words according to the outline given below in Chinese:

   1\) 住房问题在大城市变得越来越严峻

2\) 住房问题产生原因及给城市带来的影响

3\) 建议一个解决办法\(如：多造高层建筑；向地下发展；建造卫星城市；疏散城市人口等\)

How to Solve the Housing Problem in Big Cities？

With the development of modern industry, more and more people are flowing into big cities. Accordingly, the housing problem in big cities is becoming much more serious. People in the big city are complaining housing shortage and roaring price of the housing.

As we know, the temptation and opportunities provided by big cities attract people who want to make a fortune in big cities, which is the major cause of housing problem in big cities. Besides, house vacancy and speculating in the housing market are becoming the tough problem. We can't deny the housing problem has brought about great pressure to the low-income families. Meanwhile, solving this problem will affect the public's confidence on the government.

To solve this problem, I think building satellite cities in the suburbs is more practical. The fresh air and beautiful scenery in the suburbs will pull many people from the overcrowded city and alleviate the pressure of housing.

1. Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a composition on What to Emphasize in an Interview?You should write at least 120 words according to the outline given below in Chinese:
2. 1\)有人认为面试时展示自己的高学历和学习成绩至关重要。
3. 2\)另一些人认为面试时应强调自己的社会经验和实践能力。
4. 3\)我的看法。

What to Emphasize in an Interview?

Interview is the most critical moment in getting a job. Some people argue that it is important to show one's educational background and academic performance during an interview; others argue that one's social experiences and practical competence should be more focused on.

Personally, I incline to agreeing with the latter. The reason why a company chooses an employee is not that he has high marks, but that he will bring practical help to the company. High marks in examinations are nothing but theoretical knowledge and cannot prove one's real value to a company. Yet utility value is what a company most concerns while choosing employees.

So during an interview, one should show his practical ability as much as possible so as to convince the interviewer of his value to the company.

1. Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a composition on Away from Net-bar Campaign. You should write at least 120 words according to the outline given below in Chinese:

1\) 新闻媒体披露，北京某中学1000多名学生签名，庄严承诺"远离网吧"；

2\) 分析"远离网吧"运动的原因；

3\) 做出对比的评论

Away from Net-bar Campaign

```text
It has been reported that a middle school in Beijing City has recently launched a campaign named &quot;Away from Net-bar&quot;. More than a thousand students have signed for their solemn promise that they will not spend a single minute in the net-bars. With the nearing of the summer vacation, this campaign is especially meaningful for the healthy development of the minors.
```

The internet has brought people great convenience in getting information, entertainment and contact with others, and it has also benefited some businessmen, especially the owner of net-bars. While it is true that most net-bars are running legally, it is also true that some are offering unhealthy programs that involve violence and sex content. Since most middle school students are prone to be influenced and they can hardly tell which bars are doing well and which ones are not, it is only advisable that they stay away from all.

Besides, staying away from net-bars also does good to students' physical health. By passively sitting too long in front of the computer screens, both their eyesight and physique suffer.

Obviously, the Away from Net-bars Campaign is an activity worth advocating and will merit other schools' reference.

1. Olympics and I

   2008年北京将举办奥运会。请给你的朋友写一封信告诉他这个好消息，奥运会举办的重大意义以及北京的变化，并邀请他来北京观看奥运会比赛。

Dear friend,

I have a piece of great news to inform here. Through long efforts, Beijing has been granted the right to host 2008 Olympic Games. As a resident in Beijing, I feel quite excited and like to share with you my happiness.

This success means a lot more than a game to me. In the first place, this Games will definitely promote the development of our economy. According to a recent survey by some experts, this game will raise our GDP by about 3%, and offer about 10,000 jobs. What's more, our culture will be widely recognized and accepted all over the world through the Games. People will come over from every corner of the world, and experience Chinese culture in every aspect. Besides, through the games, our living environment will be greatly improved. For example, the public transportation system will be up-dated. Moreover, it's known that more trees will be planted, and grassland will be considerably expanded.

My friend, I really look forward to the coming of this great games. As an individual, I'm all ready to offer my help in any way I can. I also hope to invite you all to come here, and watch the games in 2008.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Han Dong,

I am a sophomore and I'm taking the CET-4 for the second time. It has cost lots of money and time to prepare for the exam. Meanwhile, my schedule is getting tighter, for I have to take much more classes than before. So I really want to make things work this time. That's why I'm writing to you for help.

My biggest headache is the listening part, whose proportion becomes even more after the CET exam reform. Moreover, my vocabulary is poor, too. I'm wondering if there is any short-cut to memorize words more quickly in shorter time. I also want to know in what degree a CET training class can help. Finally, I need you recommend some better books to me.

I'm gratefully looking forward to your reply.

1\) 我生活中最难忘的人是……

2\) 为什么他\(或她\)令我难以忘怀

3\) 结论

The Most Unforgettable Person I Ever Know

In my life I have met a great many people who are really worth recalling. But perhaps the most unforgettable person I ever know is my English teacher.

What frequently brings back memories of my school teacher is his special qualities. First and foremost, he gave us the greatest gift a teacher can offer—an awakening of a passion for learning. He not only led us to an appreciation of the beauty and perfection of English language and literature, but also aroused our great interest in exploring something deeper in this field. Furthermore, I was attracted by his lively wit. I remember that we students always anticipated his class with great eagerness because his lecture were humorously delivered, never failing to provoke chuckles or loud laughs.

Although it is nearly two years since I attended his last class, he is the talk of our old classmates, and I know part of him has already stayed in my heart.

1. Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a short essay on the topic Do We Need "Never give up"? You should write at least 150 words following the outline given below in Chinese:
   1. "永不言弃"一直被认为是一种积极的生活态度，是个人成功的关键因素

2. 但是，也有人认为适当的放弃才是明智的选择

3. 你对此的看法及理由

【范文】

Do We Need "Never give up"?

It is widely accepted that "Never give up", a strong and positive life attitude, is the key for individual success on the grounds that permanent persistence may boost our confidence, strengthen our will, and provide us a second chance for success when we are in hardship. However, others argue that sensible abandonment is more precious than blind persistence because the wise one should choose the most suitable area for him-self/herself.

In my opinion, we need to learn to give up timely. The most immediate reason is that we should adjust our aim carefully in order to go ahead continuously. Sometimes, to give up those unrealistic targets is essential for success. Besides, the attitude "Never give up" exhausts us both mentally and physically. Only through learning to give up can we lead a pleasant and relaxing life. Finally, the temporary comprise means a new start, a beginning bringing new hopes, expectations and opportunities for us.

Passive as giving up sounds alike, it represents a more mature and realistic mentality. If those opposing this attitude can take into consideration of its benefits, then this may seem acceptable in our lives.

1. Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a composition on the topic: My View on the Long Holidays. You should write at least 120 words following the outline given in Chinese below:
2. 休长假带来的好处；
3. 长假所带来的不利方面；
4. 你的看法。

My View on the Long Holidays

The further development of economy in China has brought the more entertainment and leisure to people's life. A case in point is the long holiday such as the National Day, in which people can spend one week or so enjoying themselves in different ways, especially going shopping and traveling. It has been agreed that the long holiday may bring much more benefit to both the customer and the businessmen.

On the other hand, however, the long holiday also brings much expectable problems to the society. First, too many visitors in the long holidays have caused the strain in traffic. Second, the visitors like to go to the well-known interesting places, which may lead to the serious damage to the nature and the scene.

In my view, people need such long holidays, and what really matters is how to guide people in their entertainment. For example, it is advisable that people try to avoid going shopping or traveling in the rush days. Anyway, the long holiday is a good idea of satisfying both the people and the merchants.

1. Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a composition on the topic What Is in the Way of Paying Back the Loans. You should write at least 120 words and base your composition on the outline given below in Chinese:

1.目前一部分学生是通过银行贷款完成学业的

2.但是有少数学生毕业后没有按时还贷

3.你认为有哪些原因，应该如何解决此类问题

What Is in the Way of Paying Back the Loans

Ever since colleges started to charge the students for the education they receive, there has always been a problem for some students, especially for those from remote rural regions, to get the money for it. So the government offers them an option of borrowing money from banks. Surveys show that the number of students financing his education in this way is increasing.

However, some students, although not many, failed to pay back the loans as they had promised in the contract. The banks have a very hard time coping with this problem. And the government can do nothing effective to help the banks.

I think there is more than one reason for this. Dishonesty may be one but not the major one. As is known, we are experiencing a particular phase of economic development where the supply of human resources is much bigger than the demand for it. So many students are not able to find a well-paid job. How can they pay the loans back? To solve this problem, I think the government should make efforts to get the whole economy go smoothly, creating more job opportunities.

1. Directions: For this part，you are allowed 30 minutes to write a composition on the topic The Post-graduate Craze. You should write at least 120 words according to the outline given below in Chinese:
2. 目前很多人报考研究生
3. 你认为此现象的原因是什么
4. 你的观点和看法

The Post-graduate Craze

```text
With the development of the competitive society, more and more people would like to go to graduate school. On one hand, thousands of ambitious young undergraduates are taking part in the National Graduate Entrance Exam each year in order to find a better job. On the other hand, more and more employees in all walks of life are trying their best to be post graduates.

There are several reasons why so many people are so enthusiastic about the post graduate studies. Firstly, the majority of the people who want to be post graduates are trying to save themselves from the employment pressure. With the development of education standard, a bachelor&#39;s degree is no longer a sufficient qualification to ensure a decent job. Secondly, although some people have been employed for years, they find the knowledge they have leaned inadequate to meet the demand of this ever changing world.
```

In my opinion, before we make the choice, those questions need to be answered: Do I need practical work experience or theoretical knowledge? Can graduate school offer me what I want to learn? We have to think carefully before we decide to apply for graduate school.

1. 爱心的力量\(The power of love\)

   When we use the word "love", we do not simply mean an attraction to a person of the opposite sex, which is a very narrow definition of the word. Love is emotional strength, which can support us no matter how dark the world around us becomes. In fact, throughout history people of many different cultures have regarded love as the noblest of human emotions.

   As an example of the power of love, we should remember how the Chinese people of all nationalities respond to the call to help the victims of natural disasters every year. Although their incomes are still low by international standards, people all over the country do not hesitate to donate whatever they can ― be it money or goods ― to help their needy fellow citizens. Moreover, they do this with no thought of gain for themselves.

   In my opinion, the best way to show love is to help people who are more unfortunate than we are. We should always be ready to give a helping hand to those who are in trouble, no matter whether they are family members or complete strangers. In this way, we can help to make the world a better place, for the darker the shadows of sorrow become, the more brightly the lamp of love shines.

\[译文\]

爱心的力量

```text
当我们用&quot;爱&quot;这个词时，我们不仅仅指异性对一个人的吸引，这只是对这个词非常狭隘的解释。爱心是一种情感的力量，不论我们周围的世界多么黑暗，爱心都能支撑我们。事实上，纵观历史，不同文化背景的人都把爱看成是人类最高尚的情感。

说到爱心的力量，我们马上就会想起每年中国各族人民是如何响应号召支援自然灾害受害者的。尽管按照国际标准他们的收入还处于低水平，全国人民毫不犹豫地倾囊相助――不管是钱还是物――帮助那些有需要的同胞。而且，他们这么做并不考虑自己的得失。

我认为，表达爱心的最好方式是帮助比我们更加不幸的人。我们应该随时准备向有困难的人伸出援助之手，无论他们是家庭成员还是素昧平生。这样，我们就能够助一臂之力把世界变成一个更美好的地方，因为，悲伤的阴影越黑暗，爱心之灯的光芒就越闪亮。

1. 大学生如何迎接2008年奥运会？\(What Can College Students Do to Welcome the 2008 Olympics?\)

提纲：

1. 北京申奥成功。
2. 申奥成功给人们带来的启示。
3. 在校大学生应如何准备迎接2008年奥运会。

范文：

```text
When learning that the 2008 Olympic Games will be held in Beijing, China, every Chinese is excited. But after that exciting moment and the ardent celebrations, all are calm to think what we can do for the Olympics, especially the college students, who will be in all walks of life in a few years.

As we know from the government officials, the weak point of Beijing lies not in the physical parts, such as roads, stadiums, or the environment, but in the cultural parts--persons. It means each one must enrich his or her knowledge and improve the behavior to be really civilized. First, language is of the utmost importance. It is the basic tool we use to communicate with foreign visitors. So students should at least grasp one foreign language. And then we need more information about our home and other countries, which will help us to have harmonious talks with our foreign guests.

All in all, no matter what we want to do, knowledge is essential. So we should cherish the opportunity of acquiring knowledge and try to learn more in order to be ready for the need of the Olympics.

It broke my heart to see all those pictures of those whose homes have been destroyed in the tragic hurricane.

I am crossing my fingers for you now in hopes that you are all safe and all right.

I can only imagine how difficult this time must be for you, and I want to extend to you my unwavering support and our government and many nongovernmental organizations are initiating various campaigns to urge people to donate some necessary things to send to America. I donated all my allowance that I have been saving for years.

1. 关于2008年雪灾作文

你的朋友对2008年发生在中国的雪灾表示关心，请写一封信向他说明一下情况。

Dear XX,

Thank you for your concern about the people in the snowstorm-hit areas in China.

107 people were killed in the heavy snowstorm which struck the southern areas of China in January 2008. Of the provincial-level areas affected, Hunan and Guizhou suffered the most. The disaster destroyed power facilities, cutting power supplies in many areas. Houses and crops were damaged. Railways and roads were also blocked. As a result, huge economic losses were caused.

So far the government has sent tens of thousands of technical workers, policemen, soldiers and medical workers to these areas. People all over China in some other countries have donated a lot food, clothes and money to help. Now things are improving.

I think we can overcome the difficulty through our hard work.

1. 关于2008年地震的作文

作文（一）

Since 12 May, 2008, I've been watching everything concerning Sichuan earthquake with deep sorrow. It's one of the terrible disaster and tragedies in history. The dreadful number of deaths has been growing every day. We are unlucky because such a great misfortune happened to us, but we are lucky because after the earthquake numerous support and assistance come from the whole country and throughout the whole world.

This is a battle against disasters joined by the whole country. In the battle we can only see the brilliant side of human beings. Numerous names like Tan Qianqiu should be loved and remembered forever.

Besides donation and close attention, I can do nothing but pray for the victims, those who are still suffering from the great pains, those who lost their beloved ones, those who are sparing no pains searching for and rescuing people buried under ruins.

Closing my eyes, crossing my fingers, I pray for the victims…

May every blessing from here be sent to Sichuan to soothe their pains.

Let the death rest in peace.

Let the living live stronger.

作文（二）

May 12th is an ordinary day in 2008, it is in this day that shocking earthquake happened in Sichuan province, China. The earthquake destroyed nearly everything in Wenchuan country Sichuan province. It was terrible. We can't describe the scene what we saw with any words. Thousands of people were injured even died. And thousands of children became such unlucky ones who lost fathers or mothers, they longed to have families to continue their lives .I am sympathetic to their fate! But I believed that we can fight against the fate and change it .For example, there many people keeping living without food or water for about 100 hours during the earthquake! What an unbelievable thing it is !their great spirits showed the powerful life vitality of humans! However, they must keep fighting against the death .Many schools were destroyed and there were many students and teachers who left us forever. Sadness, hoplessness and different kinds of danger spread out here and there! But ,fortunately ,love is around us :the Communist party helps us ,the army helps us ,the people all over the world help us .They offer us with money ,goods ,love and so on !For example ,Li lianjie, a warm-hearted man ,offered us with 20 million yuan ! With the help of the such a large love, we will over come the damage of the earthquake and face our beautiful future!

如此承诺是such a Promise

When I first look at the cartoon, I can't help laughing at the hen who seems to be seriously making a foolish announcement to the public that she always lays eggs, smooth and round and never without eggwhite and yolk inside the shell.However, when I start to study the cartoon more carefully, I find something significant in it and gradually I come to Understand the author' intention.

Nowadays,almost all trades and professions are repeatedly making sincere promises to people: government people assure that they are noble and clean and will.serve people heart and soul,merchants smilingly swear that the products they sell are of superior quality, genuine instead of false, life-time maintenance guaranteed and the cheapest market price;advertisers take pains' to recommend miracle drugs and make-you beautiful cosmetics, etc. Year after Year, such prormises are repeated. I wonder why they take so much trouble to boast loudly about their obligations and duties. People believed them at first, but gradually became awakened because they have found some dishonesty in such bombing promises.

"Actions speak louder than words." The hen is foolish enough to make her egg-promise, why shouldn't those nonsense-makers become cleverer?

满分范文：

Due Attention Should Be Given To Spelling

Nowadays, students attach less importance to the spelling of words in the process of English study. This phenomenon greatly influences students' writing and brings on worries among teachers.

There are possibly three reasons contributing to this phenomenon. First, exam-oriented education makes the students pay less attention to spelling. Second, some teachers should also be responsible for it because they don't emphasize the importance of spelling during teaching. Last but not least, some students are too lazy to recite words.

Since spelling is one of the most important factors in English study, due attention should be given to it. As for me, I think, first, exams should be modified to add some factors into it, which would help students pay more attention to spelling. Then, schools should also set effective mechanisms to help teachers as well as the students to realize the importance. Finally, for students themselves, they can, through other ways, make them be interested in word spelling. Only by these can we surly realize the importance of spelling and make improvement.

## 2010英语四级作文：Due Attention Should Be Given to Spelling

Due Attention Should Be Given to Spelling

1． 如今不少学生在英语学习中不重视拼写

2． 出现这种现象的原因

3． 我认为……（措施）

Nowadays fewer and fewer students pay attention to their word-spelling. According to a recent survey, there is a dramatic increase in the number of students who can only imitate the pronunciation of a word but be incapable of spelling it. In this essay I will discuss the factors of this phenomenon and offer my own view on it.

There are a number of factors can be accountable for this situation. One of the most common factors is that fewer and fewer students need to write English essays. Besides, the goal of most students to learn English is to speak it and pass the examination which means they just need to select the similar words according to the listening materials and passages. Perhaps the most contributing factor is the wide use of electronic devices such as e-dictionaries and computers and students no longer need to correct the words by themselves.

As far as I'm concerned, I firmly argue that we need to attach great importance to word-spelling. To the students, they should write English as much as they can. Meanwhile, to the teachers, the dictations should be reinforced in the class

A Letter to the University President

Dear Sir,

I am writing to put up some suggestions concerning our teaching and campus life.

As a sophomore from the Math Department, I am quite satisfied with the present condition of my university, but I痄 like to say that there is still some room for improvement.

First, I believe that more attention should be paid to the guidance of our study methods. To some extent, university students are capable of studying by themselves, but more often than never, we find ourselves at a loss as to choose good books to read and appropriate topics for our research. It is clear that we need some advice from our teachers. If our teachers can lecture more on "how to learn by yourself" for us, especially for the freshmen, our skills will be further improved.

Second, more activities should be conducted to make our campus life more colorful. I痦 sorry to say that the present life on campus is quite boring. Every day we have classes, read in the library, or stay in the dormitory. Life here is routine. We need more meaningful activities organized to enrich our college life and enable us to study more efficiently.

I hope you can consider my suggestions. Thank you.

Yours sincerely

Li Ming

My Opinion on Campus Lectures

In recent years, more and more lectures are being given on campus. They are organized either by the departments or by the students unions with an aim to improve the students quality both mentally and academically. These lectures are usually in series and on different topics, such as arts, life, economy, psychology and world issues.

Generally speaking, the advantages of good lectures are various. First they broaden the students knowledge horizon and cultivate interest in different fields. Second, they make the life of the students colorful and enjoyable.

With these merits, lectures are just complementary and subordinate to our school work. If students spend too much time attending lectures, their regular study will be affected and disturbed. So, in my opinion, the students should, on the one hand, do their class work and homework well first, on the other hand, set as more time as possible to attend good lectures which are helpful to our life and study.

**大学写作范文赏析：Is It Right to Require Class Attendance?**

Required class attendance， like an old custom， is so common in Chinese colleges and universities that many teachers and even students themselves simply assume it a good practice． But is it wise to do so? It does contribute to the rise in the number of students attending class． But is there any proven correlation between attendance and performance in a course? The value of required attendance is being questioned by more and more teachers and students．

Why is class attendance required? The reason seems fairly distinct and understandable． For one thing， to ensure that all the students in his or her class are attending it has been considered one of the responsibilities of the teacher in the long run． A strong sense of responsibility is acting on the teachers and making them feel lose face or even guilty if they are facing just several students in a classroom which should be filled with many more of them． Also playing a part is that teachers have to find ways to evaluate their students， and attendance， which is a perfect measurable factor， can be their good choice apart from mere paper marks．

But does that make sense? Have teachers achieved their goal? Take the first glance and people may say "yes"， because you can easily find that in the courses which require class attendance there are always a lot of students． But things are not just simply what they look like， however． "I'm tired of the course，but I've got to attend it． So I leave after my name is mentioned by the teacher．" A college student said so and if you have experienced college life， you'll find he's not alone in saying so． In some courses attendance checking has been somewhat a burden to the students and they have developed several ways to escape classes while still retain good record on the teachers' handbook．One way is to leave silently after attendance checking， and there's still other ways such as asking others to reply when his or her name is called， etc． Even just talk about the students who never escape classes． We can hardly assume they're really "taking" the course because none of the available data shows any proven correlation between attendance and performance in a course． One may be sitting in the classroom， but who knows whether he or she is just sitting there daydreaming all the time?What surprises us is that there are students who get high marks without attending many classes． So now we seem to have reached a corner： how to explain all these phenomena? Is class attendance requirement really a ridiculous thing or have we missed something important that gives us the answer?

Just consider the teachers' goal again and we can get more out of the problem． The point of all the things is that we should find a better way to arouse the students' enthusiasm and efficiency to study and attendance requirement is just one of the methods． One's course performance is measured by his or her efforts and efficiency rather than the time he spends to attend class． A student may have a high rate of attendance but low study efficiency． What's more， if we make a close research about the college education we can see why college education is not welcome． A sense of being compelled to study and not being trusted is the most important factor in it． Students in colleges tend to think they are already grown－ups who're responsible for what they can do and what they want to do． The attendance checking makes them feel that they are treated like children and thus may destroy the enthusiasm of study or even cause them to cheat the teachers in different ways． Another factor that bears the same importance is the classes， or to say the teachers them selves． Why do students fail to follow the courses? One thing that can not be denied is that many classes are simply too boring．Teachers only repeat their materials from the textbook and students feel they can gain nothing from it． For the third but not the least one， students do lack a strong desire to study and responsibility for themselves these days． Their life is filled with too many things such as PCs， TVs， and a lot of other things．These make them impetuous and unable to sit down quietly studying．

"Awareness of the problem is half of the solution，" Once Edison mentioned． Now that we have reached the conclusion that mere attendance requirement is not right， nor necessary， what shall teachers and students do to find the other half of the solution and end the "hide and see" game?

First， maintaining students attention and interest is still a big challenge for the classroom lecturers． One way for professors to meet the challenge is to brighten the classes with anecdotes for comic relief． Another way is to integrate visuals into classroom activities． Still another way is to punctuate the classes with discussion． Through all these methods the students' enthusiasm of study may be aroused and they would have the desire to study instead of being compelled to sit in the classroom thinking how to escape it．

Students themselves should take actions to solve the problems too． The essence of the problem is how to improve their study quality and students themselves， as those who benefit from all the endeavors， must give an active response to teachers and the society． Just as Newton once said， "Exploring the unknown is the happiest thing in my life．"Students must develop their interest and desire to learn in classes． They should try their best to follow the courses to get knowledge from them instead of making all kinds of excuses to escape classes．

After all， taking all these factors into account， we may safely arrive at the conclusion that to require class attendance is not an effective way to ensure the students' study quality and efficiency， but it stands for the endless endeavor of educators to improve the standard of education and to give students better tourscs． Awareness of the problem is the first step and other effective measures are being taken． We have strong belief that the situation in the near future will be better and students as well as the teachers will both get high efficiency and interest from the classes．

Just try and believe it！ We cast our eyes forward because there will be a brighter future of education！要求上课,就像一个古老的习俗,是如此普遍在中国高校,许多教师和学生也自己只是假定它是一个好的实践。但是这样做是明智的吗?它有助于学生的数量也在增加,但是上课有什么证明出勤和表现之间的相关性在课程?上课点名制度的价值正在受到越来越多的教师和学生。

为什么需要上课吗?原因似乎是相当不同的和可以理解的。首先,以确保所有的学生都在他或她的阶级参加它一直被认为是老师的责任从长远来看。责任心强是作用于教师,使他们感到丢脸或甚至内疚,如果他们正面临只是几个学生在教室里应该充满更多的学生。也在发挥作用,教师必须找到方法来评估他们的学生,并出席,这是一个完美的衡量因素,可以是他们不错的选择除了纯粹的纸标志。

但这是否有意义吗?有教师达到了他们的目标?迈出第一眼,人们可能会说"是的",因为你可以很容易地发现在课程需要上课总是有很多学生,但是事情并不只是简单的模样,然而。"我厌倦了课程,但是我必须参加它。所以我离开后,我的名字是提到老师。"一个大学生这样说的,如果你有经验丰富的大学生活,你会发现他不是一个人在这么说。在某些课程出勤检查已经有点负担,学生和他们已经发展了好几种不同的方式来逃课而仍然保持良好的记录,在教师手册的一个方法是不动声色的离开后,考勤检查还是其他方面如要求别人回答,他或她的名字叫做等等。甚至只是谈论学生从不逃课。我们几乎不能假设他们是真正的"以"课程,因为没有可用的数据显示任何证明出勤和性能之间的相关性在课程。一个可能是坐在教室里,但谁知道他或她只是坐在那里做白日梦?我们感到惊异的是,有学生得到高分没有参加很多课程。所以现在我们似乎已经达到了一个角落:如何解释这些现象?是上课的要求真的可笑的事情或有我们错过了一些重要的事情给了我们答案吗?

只是考虑到教师的目标再次和我们可以得到更多的问题。这一点在所有的事情是,我们应该找到一个更好的方法来激发学生的热情和效率研究出勤要求只是方法之一。其发展性能是衡量他或她的努力和效率而不是时间他花上课。学生可以有一个高速率的出勤但低学习效率。更重要的是,如果我们做一个关于大学教育密切研究我们可以看到为什么大学教育不是欢迎。某种意义上的被迫学习和不被信任是最重要的因素在它。在高等学校学生倾向于认为他们已经是成年人谁是负责他们所能做的,什么是他们想要做的。勤检查使他们觉得他们像对待孩子,因此可能会破坏学习的热情,甚至导致他们作弊的老师在不同的方式。另一个因素,熊同样的重要性是类,或说老师他们自我。为什么学生未能遵循课程吗?一件事,不能否认是那么多的课太无聊的老师只有重复他们的材料从教材和学生感到他们可以获得任何东西。第三但不是最少的一个,学生缺乏一个强烈的欲望去学习和责任为自己这些天来。他们的生活中充满太多的事情如电脑、电视、和许多其他的事情这些让他们冲动的和无法坐下来安静地学习。

"意识到这个问题的解决方案的一半,"一旦爱迪生提到。现在我们已经得出这样的结论:纯粹的出勤要求是不正确的,也不是必要的,老师和学生应当如何找到其他解决方案的一半和结束"隐藏和看"的游戏吗?

首先,保持学生的注意力和兴趣仍然是一个大挑战。的一个方式,教室讲师教授迎接挑战是照亮类与轶事搞笑。另一种方法是整合到课堂活动的视觉效果。还有另一种方法是更加深了类与讨论。通过这些方法,学生们的学习积极性可能引起和他们渴望学习,而不是被迫坐在教室里思考如何逃避它。

学生自己应该采取措施来解决这个问题太。问题的实质是如何提高他们的学习质量和学生本身,因为那些受益于所有的努力,必须给一个积极响应老师和社会。正如牛顿曾经说过,"探索未知,是我生命中最快乐的事"。学生必须培养他们的兴趣和学习欲望在类。他们应该尽力遵循课程从他们获得知识,而不是制造各种借口来逃避类。

毕竟,把所有这些因素考虑在内,我们可以得出以下结论,即要求上课不是一个有效的方法来保证学生的学习质量和效率,但它代表着无尽的努力的教育者提高教育的水准和给学生更好的tourscs。认识问题是第一步和其他有效的措施被采取。我们有坚定的信念,在不久的将来的情况会更好的和学生以及教师都将得到效率高、兴趣类。

简 评

一些同学在论及考评制时，往往从个人角度出发予以批判，观点有失客观。而本文作者抓住了问题的核心——单纯的考勤制并不能提高学习效果，以缜密的文思，清晰的语言对考评制这一教育手段进行了全面，深入的分析。本文不失为议论文中的佳作。

文章的布局严整，说理层次非常分明。先是提出问题（第一段），接着陈述考勤制的初衷和现实效果（二三段），进而分析考勤制的弊病及不受欢迎的原因（四段），再论及解决问题的方法（五六段），最后总结全文（七八段）。所有论证紧扣"考勤制"和"学习效果"的关系这一中心议题，步步深入，将复杂的道理讲得清清楚楚。

**Education Pays**

Judging from the table, we can see that people's income increases along with their education levels. Above all，the average college graduates earn much more than the typical high-school graduates.

The fact revealed by these data is obvious: a degree does bring distinctive financial benefits to its holders. But is it true that a degree alone can ensure a bright future? I don't think so because, on the one hand, the financial value of high education depends heavily on what skills graduates can gain from it instead of the degree itself. After all, an employer only pays for your ability and performance, not for your certificate. On the other hand, the most valuable bless high education brings to graduates is the ability to learn quickly and efficiently. People received more education tend to keep lifelong learning habits after their graduation, which would help them gain more opportunities in their career path.

In conclusion, what accounts for education pays is not the degree alone, but the graduate's ability and learning habit

Education Pay

From the bar chart given above, we can observe that it reflects the statistics of income among people of different educational background. Those who possess a doctoral degree earn 1,551dollars median weekly, ranking first among people of other education level. The median weekly earnings of people with associate degree and below can not reach the average of 797 dollars, ranking from 768 dollars to 451 dollars. As for the unemployment rate, 2.5 % of people with doctoral degree will suffer form unemployment. However, the unemployment rate of people with some college, no degree and lower degree surpass the mean value of 7.6%， ranking from 8.7% to 14.1%。

The bar chart of Education Pays reveals a phenomenon that there exits some difference in incomes and unemployment rate among people with different educational level. Quite a few reasons can account for this phenomenon: for one thing, with the advancement of technology and the adjustment of industrial structure, quite a few high-tech industries emerge overnight, which leads to a soar demand of workforces with high educational degree, thus, it is natural that graduates with bachelor' and higher degree get a high pay-packet and enjoy a stable job. Additionally, those with educational background under associate degree are easily dismissed and paid by low salary. They can be replaced any time due to the fact that their jobs are easy and can be finished by average people。

Definitely, the higher education degree you get, the more likely you are to enjoy a competitive edge in the employment market. Thus, the authorities should enforce some policies to ensure the equity of education. Only in this way can more people lead a stable and comfortable life
